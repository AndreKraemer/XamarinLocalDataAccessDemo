# Xamarin local data access demo
Demo project for my Xamarin local data access talks

This is a demo project that I use for my Xamarin local data access talks. It demonstrates accessing and copying / modifying base data delivered with the app, storage of sensitive information like credentials and access tokens as well as sqlite and entity framework core.

## Do you need help with your Xamarin projects?
I do offer consulting services in the Xamarin area! I work both, remote and onsite.
